# Unipi free classrooms now
Simply and fast see the classrooms that are vacant (free) now at the University of Pisa!

## Why?
Because the official schedule (available [here](https://aule.webhost1.unipi.it)), is complete, but in the large educational poles with so many classrooms and lectures throughout the day, seeing the classrooms that are free in a given time and how long they will remain so, where you can go to study (maybe with some colleagues to speak with, not allowed in the official study rooms) gives me a headache, it almost feels like solving an operations research problem...

## Data source
The data comes from the official schedule (available [here](https://aule.webhost1.unipi.it)). The data are simply parsed.

## There are already other apps developed by other students!
Yes, but some have stopped working and some do not work on computers and iOS.

## It is very basic!
This is not meant to be a solution with lots of features, just a quick tool for what in my experience I believe is the most common need.

This tool is UNOFFICIAL, developed by a student.
